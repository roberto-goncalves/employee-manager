# Task-Manager using SpringBoot and MongoDB

1 - Requirements:

- Java 8
- Maven 3.6+
- Docker
- Docker-compose

2 - Explanations:

- The configuration for mongodb connection is on config/MongoConfig.java, if you have a database accessed to localhost for example, just change there. The default value is mongodb:27017 (used in docker-compose)
- The MetricFilter class will gather every request made to the api, and save it on mongodb
- Integration tests is on src/tests
- The logging is configured also on MetricFilter

3 - Compile & Use API:

To compile tests: mvn test or mvn package - Remember to configure your mongodb correct host

To compile without tests: mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true

To run in standalone: mvn spring-boot:run - will run on localhost:8080

To run with docker-compose: docker-compose up (need to be on same folder as docker-compose.yml) will bind to 8080 for application and 27017 for mongodb on 0.0.0.0

A simple example with whole workflow:

```bash
sudo docker-compose down && mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true && sudo docker-compose up --build
```


4 - Using the API:

A instance in AWS was launched at public ip 54.161.4.37

- POST /employee/ - Insert new employee
- PUT /employee/  - Update existing employee
- GET /employee/  - Get all employee
- GET /employee/<organization>  - Get employee by organization with Regex and Insentive
- DELETE /employee/ - Delete all employee

/employee
```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-type: application/json" --resolve 'swiss.com:80:54.161.4.37' http://swiss.com/employee/dev -u swisscom:pass

EMPLOYEE API - METRIC

- GET /employeemetrics/ - Will return every request made to the API
- GET /employeemetrics/stats - Will return a statistic metric for every request made, those metrics are: totaltime, totalcount and average response time in ms

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-type: application/json" --resolve 'swiss.com:80:54.161.4.37' http://swiss.com/employeemetrics/stats -u swisscom:pass
